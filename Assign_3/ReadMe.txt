The author of this program is Kyle Gourlie. The author manually created the Excel sheet for the proper format of the timecard, created the Graphical User Interface of the program, and designed/created all the methods and attributes of the program. Note that the program is not fully completed, but valid entries within the GUI have been roughly tested and have seen success in uploading data onto Excel and downloading a PDF copy of the timesheet. More entries are required, but the same methods will be used. An extra portion of this script will be saving a text or binary copy of the timesheet, that can be unpickled and retrieved to create a timesheet later. Also, an encrypter could be implemented here possibly for fun. 

Here are the following external libraries used in the Program:

-sys
-PySide6
-openpyxl 
-win32com
-os

To install these libraries, go into the terminal and type 'pip install ___' where ___ is the library. 

Also, I don't own the rights to use the brand of NSP, so don't share this assignment, please. This is just a fun project that 'no one' will be using.
